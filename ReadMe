This data and code is for the work: 'Smaller than the unit cell: Smallest Repeating Units of Zeolite Frameworks'

Data for hypothetical zeolite SRUs can be accessed at the google drive link:

Connectivity Matrix data exists in 2 formats, hamsolyes.txt and the CMatrix.dat
Scripts to read from the CMatrix.dat and study the Hamiltonian nature for any CMatrix have been given. 
These scripts are for individual study of zeolites and thus only can be done on single files. Results have been presented by iterating over all files.
